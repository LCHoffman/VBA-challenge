#The .PNG Files are the screenshots of the Multi Year Stock Data

I don't know how the screenshots of the Multi Year Stock Data will appear on your machine.  I use colorblindness filters on my computer which alter the colors of the screen.  You can see in the AllData code that I used the red and green color index for those cells.

I have included the Excel file for the alphabetical test data after running the codes on it.
